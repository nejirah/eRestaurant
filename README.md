# eRestaurant

# Project Overview

The eRestaurant project aimed to create a modern and efficient restaurant management system that caters to both customers and staff members. Leveraging the power of Azure tools and services, the project tackled various aspects of the restaurant experience, including reservations, order management, FAQ sections, coupon utilization, and user payments.

# My Contributions
Throughout the course of this project, I played a significant role in shaping and implementing critical components of the application:

User Interface Creation: I was responsible for crafting an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that facilitated seamless interactions between customers and the application's functionalities.

Database and Backend Development: I designed and implemented the backend infrastructure that enabled smooth access to different modules of the eRestaurant application. This included setting up the backend logic for the overview, reservations, FAQ, coupons, orders, and payment review.

User Registration and Login: One of the key functionalities I contributed was the user registration and login system. This involved understanding token-based authentication, implementing secure password handling, and incorporating 2-factor authentication through email verification.

Working with Multimedia Data: I extended the application's capabilities by integrating the storage and retrieval of images in the database. This encompassed working with base64 encoding formats and ensuring efficient image handling.

Real-time Communication and Notifications: To enhance user engagement, I integrated the SignalR library, enabling real-time communication and notifications. Users can now receive instant updates on various events within the application.

# Technologies Used
The eRestaurant project was developed using a combination of powerful technologies:

Backend: The backend was built using the ASP.NET Core framework, providing a robust foundation for the application's logic and data management.

Frontend: The frontend was developed using the Angular framework, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface that seamlessly interacts with the backend.

Azure Tools: Throughout the project, we leveraged various Azure tools and services to optimize performance, ensure scalability, and enhance security.
